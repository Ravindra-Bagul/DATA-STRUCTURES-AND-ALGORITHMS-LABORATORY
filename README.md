# DATA-STRUCTURES-AND-ALGORITHMS-LABORATORY
All Data Structures and Algorithm Laboratory Assignments of SPPU Second Year Computer Engineering Syllabus
 
ASSIGNMENT NO. : 1
  Consider telephone book database of N clients. Make use of a hash table 
  implementation to quickly lookupclient‘s telephone number. Make useoftwo
  collision handling techniques and compare them using number of comparisons 
  required to find a set of telephone numbers. Write a Python program for the 
  same

ASSIGNMENT NO. 2:
  To create ADT that implements the “set” concept
  a) Add (new element) - place a value into a set
  b) Remove (element) - remove the value
  c) Contains (element) - return true if element is in a collection
  d) Size () - return number of values in collection 
     iterator() return an iterator used to loop over collection
  e) Intersection of two sets.
  f) Union of two set 
  g) Difference between two sets
  h) Subset

ASSIGNMENT NO. 3
  Beginning with an empty binary search tree, Construct binary search tree 
  by inserting the values in the order given. After constructing a binary tree -
  i.Insert new node, ii. Find number of nodes in longest path from root, iii. 
  Minimum data value found in the tree, iv. Change a tree so that the roles of the
  left and right pointers are swapped at every node, v. Search a value.

Assignment No 4:
  Convert given binary tree into threaded binary tree. 
  Analyze time and space complexity of an algorithm.

Assignment No 5:
  A Dictionary stores keywords & its meanings. Provide facility for adding new keywords,deleting keywords, 
  updating values of any entry. Provide facility to display whole data sorted in ascending/ Descending order. 
  Also find how many maximum comparisons may require for finding anykeyword. 
  Use Binary search tree and find the complexity for finding a keyword.

ASSIGNMENT NO. 6
  There are flight paths between cities. If there is a flight between city A and city B then 
  there is an edge between the cities. The cost of the edge can be the time that flight takes 
  to reach city B from A, or the amount of fuel used for the journey. Represent this as a graph. 
  The node can be represented by airport name or name of the city. Use adjacency list representation
  of the graph or use adjacency matrix representation of the graph.

ASSIGNMENT NO. 7
  You have a business with several offices; you want to lease phone lines to connect them up with each other; 
  and the phone company charges different amounts of money to connect different pairs of cities. 
  You want a set of lines that connects all your offices with a minimum total cost. Solve the problem 
  by suggesting appropriate data structures.

ASSIGNMENT NO. 8
  Given sequence k = k1 <k2 < … < kn of n sorted keys, with a search probability pi for each key ki. 
  Build the Binary search tree that has the least search cost given the access probability for each key?

ASSIGNMENT NO. 9
  Dictionary  stores  keywords  &  its  meanings.  Provide  facility  for  adding  new  keywords, deleting keywords, 
  updating values of any entry. Also,display whole data sorted in ascending or descending order. 
  Find how many maximum comparisons may require for finding any keyword. Use height balance tree 
  and find the complexity for finding a keyword.

ASSIGNMENT NO. 10
  Read the marks obtained by students of second year in an online examination of particular subject. 
  Find out maximum and minimum marks obtained in a subject. Use heap data structure. Analyze the algorithm
 
ASSIGNMENT NO. 11
  Department maintains a student information. The file contains roll number, name, division and address. 
  Allow user to add, delete information of student. Display information of particular employee. 
  If record of student does not exist an appropriate message is displayed. If it is, then the system 
  displays the student details. Use sequential file to main the data

ASSIGNMENT NO. 12
  Company maintains employee information as employee ID, name, designation and salary. Allow user to add, delete 
  information of employee. Display information of particular employee. If employee does not exist an appropriate 
  message is displayed. If it is, then the system displays the employee details. Use index sequential file to 
  maintain the data.
